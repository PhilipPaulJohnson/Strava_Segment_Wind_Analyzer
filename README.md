*see doc-scrnshts folder

OVERVIEW: This application will allow a cyclist publicly tracked by Strava to select any Strava segment effort for analysis/determination of optimal wind speed & direction of that segment

HOW IT WORKS: Using the Strava and Timeline Weather API, the application administrator will be able to view and select an athleteâ€™s Strava segment(s) for analysis and insertion into the SQL database. When the database is sufficiently populated, the admin may use PG Admin to query the SQL database using new or preset scripts

WHERE IT'S GOING: This app can be improved with catch-alls, procedures wrapped into functions, OOP... in the next version


TECHNOLOGIES:

Python: base app

Flask: framework

SQL Alchemy: tables & insertions prepared in Object Relational Model format

Alembic: database migrations

Docker: Postgres server & database containerization

PG Admin: Postgres database administration


INSTALL:

1. insert flask/segment_analyzer folder (with files) into directory

2. create the flask folder venv / select venv interperter  

3. install requirements (python -m pip install -r requirements.txt)

4. create pgadmin containers with docker-compose.yml (docker compose up -d)

5. create server in PG Admin

6. (docker exec -i pg_container psql -c 'CREATE DATABASE efforts;')

7. check: __init__.py = (SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI='postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/efforts',) OR your db.uri

8. inside segment_analyzer folder: (flask db migrate) THEN (flask db upgrade)


AUTHORIZATION:

1. follow instructions to obtain Strava API authorization and subsequent authorization code. developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/ 

2. insert client ID, client secret & authorization code into nu_auth.py and run. copy refresh and access tokens into the refresh_token & access_token variables (lines 42 & 44)

3. insert Strava API variables into drivercode.py (segment_id, start_date, end_date, per_page)

4. follow instructions to obtain Timeline Weather API authorization @ visualcrossing.com

5. insert Timeline Weather API variables into drivercode.py (apikey, maxDistance, timelineAuthCode)


RUN:

1. run drivercode.py
